I hold a degree in Japanese Literature from Sophia University, graduating in May 2020 in Japan and relocated to California later that year. I worked for a tennis instructor, an export freight Forwarder, and an elementary school teacher.

My interest in web development was always present, but it was my move to the US that opened doors for me to truly immerse myself in it.
